    <div>
        <p>You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results in perfect noodles tossed in exactly the right amount of butter. Once you try these four-ingredient buttered noodles, you'll never go back to your old method again.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> Noodles:</strong>his recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong> Butter:</strong>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>

   Boil the fettuccine in lightly salted water until it's tender, yet still firm. Drain the pasta in a colander, then return it to the pot. Mix butter, cheese, salt, and pepper into the cooked noodles until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</p>
